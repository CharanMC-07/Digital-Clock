### 📌 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

The **Digital Clock** is a simple, responsive, and visually appealing web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Its main purpose is to display the current time dynamically in a digital format, updating every second to reflect real-time changes. The project demonstrates the core principles of front-end development — structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and interactivity (JavaScript).

### 🚀 **FEATURES**

* Displays the **current time** in real-time (updates every second).
* Uses **12-hour format** with AM/PM indication.
* **Responsive design** that works smoothly on any screen size.
* **Elegant UI** with gradients, shadows, and smooth text formatting.
* Easy to customize (fonts, colors, or background themes).

### 🧩 **TECHNOLOGIES USED**

| Technology           | Purpose                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **HTML5**            | Structure of the clock interface         |
| **CSS3**             | Styling, layout, and design effects      |
| **JavaScript (ES6)** | Real-time functionality and time updates |

### 🧠 **HOW IT WORKS**

* The `Date()` object in JavaScript retrieves the current system time.
* Hours, minutes, and seconds are extracted and formatted into a readable digital style.
* A **12-hour clock format** is implemented with an AM/PM indicator.
* The `setInterval()` function refreshes the displayed time every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) to maintain real-time accuracy.
* The time is displayed inside an HTML element dynamically updated through the DOM.
